# Recognize hand written digits with Pytorch
I built two-layer and three-layer neural network using pytorch to classify image of written digits available in the MNIST database, and explore the influences of different parameters:
- Learning rate
- Weight decay parameters
- Dropout
- Size of hidden layer
